### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--

I am an aspiring front end developer. I am currently a student of Practicum SE bootcamp. I will graduate as a full stack JavaScript developer on October. 

I'm currently working on a social media profile page with user interaction.

I'm currently learning JavaScript! 

I am sufficent in HTML/CSS, Git, Github and figma! My skills and knowledge are growing more everyday. 

I am looking to collaborate on outsourced projects.

Any help or advice from experience SE is always welcomed and appricated! I am excited to be in this new community.
